%description
The manual is provided as Texinfo source (which was originally derived
from the VMS help file in the DECUS TeX distribution of 1990, with many
subsequent changes). This is a collaborative development, and details of
getting involved are to be found on the package home page. A Spanish
translation is included here, and a French translation is available as a
separate package. All the other formats in the distribution are derived
from the Texinfo source, as usual.
